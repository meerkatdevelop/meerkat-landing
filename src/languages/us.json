For a long time, they were overlooked, but now they’re ready to change the game. That’s how $MERK was born: the token that unites the pack to transform the meerkat into the most powerful animal. Together, we’ll move fast, stay agile, and build something big. No empty promises—just a community ready to have fun and make some noise."
